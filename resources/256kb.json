                    "body": "I believe I have addressed everything discussed in #478. @josevalim please take a thorough look once you have a chance because it ended up being less rework than I thought. The Publisher (PubSub) API remained exactly the same and is implemented per your description. Notable changes:\r\n\r\n1. `socket` API in the router. Socket endpoints are now configured via the `socket` macro and house the channel definitions. Channels can also now be scoped based on transport, i.e.:\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\n  defmodule MyApp.Router do\r\n    use Phoenix.Router\r\n\r\n    socket \"/ws\", MyApp do\r\n      channel \"topic1:*\",  MyChannel\r\n      channel \"baretopic\", MyChannel\r\n      channel \"wsonly:*\",  MyChannel, via: [Phoenix.Transports.WebSocket]\r\n      channel \"lponly:*\",  MyChannel, via: [Phoenix.Transports.LongPoller]\r\n    end\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. The \"topic\" abstraction is now *only a string identifier*. We used to conflate the channel name and topic names. Now `channel \"foo:*\"` refers to the topic \"foo\" and any pattern following \"foo:\". By convention, we use \"topic:subtopic\", but the splat \"*\" does not require a colon.\r\n\r\n3. Likewise, in the channel callbacks, you now match on the topic directly:\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\n# router\r\nchannel \"rooms:*\", RoomChannel\r\n\r\n# channel\r\ndef join(\"rooms:lobby\", message, socket) do ...\r\ndef join(\"rooms:\" <> room_id, message, socket) do ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. All channel callbacks now accept `socket` as the last argument to more closely follow a GenServer API where the state is held in the last arg and the message is matched int he first.\r\n\r\n5. Transports now use two flavors of messages, `{:socket_reply, %Message{...}}` and `{:socket_broadcast, %Message{...})` to differentiate replies from broadcasts. This was required to support `outgoing` callbacks.\r\n\r\n6. `event` has been renamed to `incoming` and now channel callbacks can filter/intercept/modify broadcasts with an `outgoing` callback for per-socket customization, i.e.:\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\ndef incoming(\"new:msg\", %{\"from_id\" => from_id, \"body\" => body}, socket) do\r\n  # broadcast incoming new message to all subscribers\r\n  broadcast socket, \"new:msg\", %{body: body, from_id: from_id}\r\nend\r\n\r\n# each socket's outgoing callback will be triggered for per-socket\r\n# customization of broadcast. Sockets can also not reply to filter broadcasts\r\n# from being relayed.\r\ndef outgoing(\"new:msg\", msg, socket) do\r\n  user = socket.assigns[:user]\r\n\r\n  reply socket, \"new:msg\", Dict.merge(msg,\r\n    is_editable: can_edit?(user, msg.from_id),\r\n    is_friend: is_friend?(user, msg.from_id)\r\n  )\r\nend\r\n\r\n# by default just forward reply\r\ndef outgoing(event, msg, socket) do\r\n  reply socket, event, msg \r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Points of discussion for the 0.8.0 release:\r\n\r\n- Should incoming/outgoing be renamed to a more GenServer'esque API? i.e. `handle_incoming`, `handle_outgoing`? I prefer the current naming, but `handle_` could be more welcoming to newcomers who would find it more familiar to GenServer style.\r\n- Should we embed the `node()` my default in the message to allow per-node filtering? I opted not to since end-users can attach their `node()` themselves in the broadcasted message if they need per-node handling. Subscribers can pick up the message the compare their node().\r\n- Others?\r\n\r\n\r\n### Points of discussion for 0.9.0+:\r\n\r\nAs discussed on IRC, we need to tackle handling missed messages with a configurable backend. Today, the LongPoller requires a cookie session, and clustered nodes. The PubSub also requires clustering. We would like to move towards a configurable store with `last_seen_id` tracking of messages, for replaying messages between client drops, as well as a solution to non-clustered pubsub servers.\r\n\r\nLet me know how it looks!

I added the missing three and reworked many of the others to 1) maintain balance between light and heavy armor types, 2) make sure the light/heavy status reflects the nature of the enchantment, 3) make dragon priest masks worth having compared to low- or mid-tier armor types, and 3) feature the maximum variety of material types, all while 4) ensuring the material type matches the mask's appearance (with the exception of Miraak, which I left unchanged). Here's the specifics:\r\n\r\nAdded the three other Dragon Priest Masks from Dragonborn:\r\nAhzidal - ScaledHeavy\r\nDukaan - HNordicHigh\r\nZahkriisos - EbonyLight\r\n\r\nChanged some of the materials on the existing Dragon Priest mask entries:\r\nOtar - GoldHeavy (from Glass) - better suited to heavy armor, and doesn't look like glass; glass is blue. The glass mask should probably be:\r\nMorokei - Glass (from Elven) - Krosis is already elven, so this prevents repeats (and it looks great with glass armor).\r\nVokun - LNordicHigh (from Steel Plate) - enchantment is better suited to light armor wearers.\r\nRahgot - OrkishLight (from Orkish) - enchantment is better suited to light armor wearers.\r\n\r\nKicked the stats for some of the other masks up to \"_High\" - nothing's more depressing than a crappy Dragon Priest mask. Specifically:\r\nKonahrik - DwarvenHigh (from Dwarven)\r\nHevnoraak - IronHigh (from Iron)\r\nVolsung - ScaledHigh (from Scaled) - it has a crappy enchantment, so it needs the armor rating boost.\r\nKrosis - ElvenHigh (from Elven)\r\n\r\nThis leaves us with 7 heavy and 6 light masks - Seems balanced.\r\n\r\nTL;DR I expanded and reworked Dragon Priest masks."
